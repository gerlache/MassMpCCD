Most important:

- Check age difference between astorb.dat for astcheck, MpCCD, and picture date

- Write picture.ini, it currently only works with:
     for i in *.fit; do mv $i `md5sum $i | cut -f1 -d' '`.fit; done;
and
     for i in *.fit; do replacekey -p OBJECT -v "''" $i; done;
done in the fits folder. This sucks, you have to backup your fitsfiles currently


Less important:

- Checks for everything, try/catch.

- Sane progress indicator
